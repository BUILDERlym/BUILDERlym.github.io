I am a second-year Ph.D. student in [CS](https://computerscience.emory.edu/index.html) at [Emory University](https://www.emory.edu/home/index.html) advised by [Prof. Fei Liu](https://www.cs.emory.edu/~fliu40/index.html). Previously, I was fortunate to work with [Prof. Jinli Suo](https://www.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1225/2315.htm) in Computational Photography at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/). My research interests are in the areas of NLP, especially tasks realted to LLM reasoning and decision making.
