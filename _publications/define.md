title: "DeFine: Enhancing LLM Decision-Making with Factor Profiles and Analogical Reasoning"
collection: publications
category: preprints
permalink: /publication/define
excerpt: 'This paper presents DeFine, a novel approach that bolsters LLM-based decision-making through factor profiles and analogical reasoning. By systematically identifying and comparing key factors across contexts, DeFine promotes deeper context comprehension and more robust inferences. Our experiments on finance-related reasoning tasks demonstrate its ability to deliver both higher accuracy and enhanced interpretability, with broader applications to various decision-making scenarios.'
