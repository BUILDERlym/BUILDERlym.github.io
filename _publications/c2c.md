title: "Communication to Completion: Modeling Collaborative Workflows with Intelligent Multi-Agent Communication"
collection: publications
category: preprints
permalink: /publication/c2c
excerpt: 'In this work, we introduce Communication to Completion (C2C), a scalable multi-agent framework
that enhances task oriented collaboration through structured communication. C2C features the
Alignment Factor (AF), a novel metric quantifying task understanding, and a Sequential Action
Framework that enables cost aware communication decisions. Evaluated on realistic coding workflows
across varying team sizes and complexity tiers, C2C reduces task completion time by 40%, establishing
both theoretical foundations and practical utilities for communication efficient multi-agent systems.'

This paper presents DeFine, a novel approach that bolsters LLM-based decision-making through factor profiles and analogical reasoning. By systematically identifying and comparing key factors across contexts, DeFine promotes deeper context comprehension and more robust inferences. Our experiments on finance-related reasoning tasks demonstrate its ability to deliver both higher accuracy and enhanced interpretability, with broader applications to various decision-making scenarios.
