This paper presents STRUX, which is a novel LLM framework that enhances decision-making through structured explanations. By distilling complex information into key facts and employing self-reflection steps, it categorizes and prioritizes factors affecting decisions. We demonstrate its effectiveness in stock investment decisions based on earnings call transcripts, making LLM decision-making more transparent and practical.
